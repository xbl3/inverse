:://;long notes goto:28

rem Winders loves to start at Z: // for everything \\ pushd/unc etc
rem I get why cause it's the fucking only thing left using "if not exist"
rem pushd=great for unc as it's simple one-liner, but forget popd and fuckin-A

rem subst on the other had is great for almost anything but it doesn't auto-assign
rem it's also great to cleanup after, for both the symlink and mountpoint, as subst gives both
rem if you also employ the delayedexpansion while building your array you can invert the response

rem ie if not exist %%i set use=%%i // results in last which is zyx etc
rem as some apps etc don't like or allow mounting below C: for some reason
rem with delays instead of building the array "x=!x! %%x" flip it around
rem doing this also will get rid of the leading space that will often show up
rem like in above example as technically your results show on pass two 
rem the first pass is going to give you that gap and tilde don't/can't/won't clear it
rem by inverting and doing "x=%%x !x!" you can still keep space as a delimiter 
rem your results will also become inverted so right2left now is left2right
rem so sticking with drive results come back as zxy etc
rem now you'll get abc, so why Z: is often in use so subst is out there
rem I'm pretty sure A: B: are almost always fucking available cause who uses floppies anymore
rem I actually do use a/b by changing drives off d/e and why I went with U: to start
rem anyways too long of notes and this still needs cleaning as a lot of fuckery is present
